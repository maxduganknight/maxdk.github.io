Welcome to my personal website. I'm interested in using data to improve public policy. 

I am currently pursuing a Master's degree at the London School of Economics and Political Science in Applied Social Data Science where I apply quantitative methods like machine learning to social science problems. I am also a part-time Data Science Research Assistant at the [Care Policy and Evaluation Centre][Care Policy and Evaluation Centre].

Before coming to LSE, I spent 4 years working with data at [YouthTruth][YouthTruth] to help schools in the U.S. improve learning outcomes for students. My work was a blend of data analysis, product development, building data pipelines, automating previously manual tasks, and communicating quantitative insights to the team.
