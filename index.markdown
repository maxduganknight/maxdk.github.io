Welcome to my personal website! I'm a Data Scientist interested in solving problems with data and machine learning. 

I currently work at [DataRobot][DataRobot] where I help organizations create value from their data using automated machine learning. I have a Master's degree from the London School of Economics and Political Science in Applied Social Data Science where I applied machine learning and NLP to social science problems. I was also a part-time Data Science Research Assistant at the [Care Policy and Evaluation Centre][Care Policy and Evaluation Centre].

Before LSE I spent 4 years working with data at [YouthTruth][YouthTruth] to help schools in the U.S. improve learning outcomes for students. My work was a blend of data analysis, product development, building data pipelines, automating previously manual tasks, and communicating quantitative insights to the team. 

Feel free to explore some of my previous work using the Projects link above and reach out!
